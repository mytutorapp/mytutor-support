<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<div class="content">

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2026</p>

<p>My Tutor is designed to support learning while respecting user privacy.</p>

<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>

<p>My Tutor does not require account creation and does not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, precise location data, or advertising identifiers.</p>

<p>The app does not track users across apps or websites and does not sell personal data.</p>

<h2>Information Sent to Third-Party AI Service</h2>

<p>When a user submits a question in the app, the following information is transmitted securely to a third-party AI provider (OpenAI) for the sole purpose of generating an educational response:</p>

<ul>
<li>The text of the user’s question</li>
<li>The selected teaching style or tutor mode</li>
<li>Recent conversation messages (if part of the active chat session)</li>
</ul>

<p>This information is sent only when the user taps the send button. No background transmission occurs.</p>

<p>No account identifiers, contact details, or device identifiers are attached to these requests.</p>

<h2>Purpose of Data Processing</h2>

<p>The transmitted information is used exclusively to generate tutoring responses within the app. It is not used for advertising, profiling, or marketing.</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>

<p>Chat messages are stored locally on the user’s device during use of the app. The developer does not maintain a separate user database of personal identities.</p>

<h2>Payments</h2>

<p>Subscriptions are processed securely through Apple’s App Store. The developer does not receive or store payment card details.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>My Tutor is designed for general educational use. Users are advised not to submit sensitive personal information in chat messages.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>All communication with third-party services uses encrypted connections (HTTPS).</p>
